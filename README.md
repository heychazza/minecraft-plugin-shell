# Minecraft Plugin Shell
This is a pre-made, ready-to-go shell structure for creating Minecraft plugins with an SDK included. I have created this repo to aid myself when building plugins, as the initial setup for a multi-module gradle project can be tedious and overall a pain.

## Installation
1. Press the "Use this Template" at the top.
2. Enter your new repo credentials etc.
3. Now run `git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git`
